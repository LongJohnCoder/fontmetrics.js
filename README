This library updates the canvas2d ctx.measureText(<String>) function
so that it returns not just a string's width, but also its height,
ascent wrt the baseline, descent wrt the baseline, the leading distance
(the number of pixels between the baselines of two consecutive lines
of text, pronounced like the metal "lead", not like the management
"leader"), as well as the string's bounding box.

Simply include on a page as:

  <script type="text/javascript" src="fontmetrics.js"></script>

and measureText will return a much more complete object, structured
as follows:

{
  fontsize: <number>,
  width: <number>,
  height: <number>,
  ascent: <number>,
  descent: <number>,
  leading: <number>,
  bounds:
  { 
    minx: <number>,
    miny: <number>,
    maxx: <number>,
    maxy: <number>
  }
}

Note: all numbers represent screen pixels (not typographical points)

See http://pomax.github.com/fontmetrics.js/ for a demonstration.
